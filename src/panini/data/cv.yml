      <p>Six weeks of taking pictures, thousands of miles later, hours of editing and I'm a published photographer. Outrunning forest fires, barely missing deer at night, and the occasional fallen tree blocking all exits only made the experience more memorable. Thank you to my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barbara.keck.writes" target="_blank">Barbara Keck</a> who invited me along on her quest to write the ultimate guide to the people and the wineries of the Sierra Foothills. This book consists of personal stories, family recipes and a complete directory of the 10 counties of the California Sierra Foothills.</p>

      <p>Shopify is the solution recommended by my friends at <a href="http://www.baronfig.com/" target="_blank">Baron Fig</a> when I was researching an ecommerce solution for Wineries of the Sierra Foothills. It's a hosted solution that gives you extraordinary control over the both the look and functionality of your site. With their templating language, you have complete control over the design of the site. Their API and webhooks allow you integrate with a variety of third-party services and let you build your own. You get all the benefits of a hosted solution plus the control of having your own hosted site. Check out my <a href="http://bootstrap-theme-store.myshopify.com" target="_blank">demo shop</a> in progress using Bootstrap as the base. </p>
